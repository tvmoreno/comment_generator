This course introduces the basic language and core principles of economics in a non-traditional way. You will develop an economic way of thinking - like an economist - using chains of deductive reasoning in conjunction with simplified models. A Microeconomic and Macroeconomic analysis will help explain why individuals, businesses, and even governments behave as they do. 

Kyle, in your class reflection, you recognized your developement, saying:
"Oh yeah, everything made sense. That economy really just started running well in my brain."

	- Kyle, you are consistently able to express ideas or fluently and coherently.
	- You have also shown your capacity to apply and adapt previous learning to tackle new problems.
	- However, I find that you struggle to use appropriate tools strategically at times.
 A strategy to help develop your proficiency is working with Maego & myself (or future teachers) to define apporach strategies.

You showed slight improvement through the semester, with a 5 percent increase between the key assessments.

In your essay titled "Why Capitalism Is Bust," I was impressed by your language and thoughtfulness when you wrote the following:
"Considering the ineptitude of meritocracy in regulation of communism, I believe capitalism finds itself doomed to fail in a system where those in power don't work to ensure a stable system."
It was quite exciting to see your thoughtfulness in this paper. 

Keep up the good work Kyle! Your final grade for this class: A. Kyle, it was wonderful to have you in class this semester. Your focus, energy, and collaborative spirit were on full display every day, and you were an excellent partner in the learning process for everyone in the room. I look forward to all of your future successes at OES and beyond, and thank you!
