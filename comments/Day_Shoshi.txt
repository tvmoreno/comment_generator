This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.  A successful student will know more advanced data structures and object-oriented programming basics.  A successful student will be able to communicate with popular APIs including Twitter and Google in order to “grab” data and to organize the data and display it. 

Day, in your class reflection, you recognized your developement, saying:
"...I don't feel that great. I tried though. Sorry! Haha..."

	- Day, you are consistently able to attend to precision.
	- You have also shown your capacity to make sense of material and persevere through work.
	- However, I find that you struggle to reason abstractly at times.
 A strategy to help develop your proficiency is explaining concepts to others in a teaching format.

Although Day's test scores did not increase, Day's showed improvement in some aspects.
I recommend reaching out to Maego and your advisor for academic support. That may be the best solution to get you back onto a more confident academic path! 
Hello Day. You have shown understanding on some of the concepts we have learned in this class. Your final grade for this class: C.Day, it was great having you in this class this semester. You may not have gotten the grade that you strived to receive. As we've spoken about multiple times throughout the semester, I would encourage you to check in with your teachers during free block throughout your courses to make sure you are staying on track. I look forward to seeing you progress as a learner!
