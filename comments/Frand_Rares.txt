This course introduces the basic language and core principles of economics in a non-traditional way. You will develop an economic way of thinking - like an economist - using chains of deductive reasoning in conjunction with simplified models. A Microeconomic and Macroeconomic analysis will help explain why individuals, businesses, and even governments behave as they do. 

Frand, in your class reflection, you recognized your developement, saying:
"I'm gonna make so much utility now! Who needs money on its own."

	- Frand, you are consistently able to use appropriate tools strategically.
	- You have also shown your capacity to make sense of material and persevere through work.
	- However, I find that you struggle to attend to precision at times.
 A strategy to help develop your proficiency is explaining the reasoning behind each decision made in your work.

You showed slight improvement through the semester, with a 3 percent increase between the key assessments.

In your essay titled "I Wish I Was In The Soviet Union," I was impressed by your language and thoughtfulness when you wrote the following:
"Considering the difficulties that life proposes and threatens us with each day, I find myself dreaming of a system that reduces obligation and pressure, even at the loss of my personhood."
It was quite exciting to see your thoughtfulness in this paper. 

Keep up the good work Frand! Your final grade for this class: A-. Frand, it was wonderful to have you in class this semester. Your focus, energy, and collaborative spirit were on full display every day, and you were an excellent partner in the learning process for everyone in the room. I look forward to all of your future successes at OES and beyond, and thank you!
