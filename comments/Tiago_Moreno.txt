AP Statistics involves descriptive statistics (interpreting, organizing, and visualizing data), research design (designing survey, observational studies, and experiments), probability theory, simulation (modeling real-world situations with calculators and computers), and statistical inference. This course is equivalent to one semester of college-level Statistics and prepares students to take the AP Statistics exam. 

Tiago, in your class reflection, you recognized your developement, saying:
"I ate this class up honestly."

	- Tiago, you are consistently able to use appropriate tools strategically.
	- You have also shown your capacity to develop and evaluate unique ideas.
	- However, I find that you struggle to make sense of material and persevere through work at times.
 A strategy to help develop your proficiency is interpreting the material in new spaces, allowing for new ideas.

You showed slight improvement through the semester, with an 8 percent increase between the key assessments.
You were very thoughtful, beyond even my wildest dreams. Your academics were all too well-ly done. I hope you don't take this new knowledge and shake it off! 
Keep up the good work Tiago! Your final grade for this class: A. Tiago, it was wonderful to have you in class this semester. Your focus, energy, and collaborative spirit were on full display every day, and you were an excellent partner in the learning process for everyone in the room. I look forward to all of your future successes at OES and beyond, and thank you!
