The AP Spanish Language and Culture course is equivalent to an intermediate-level college course in Spanish. This rigorous course is taught exclusively in Spanish and requires students to improve their proficiency across the three modes of communication. 

R.E., in your class reflection, you recognized your developement, saying:
"Muchas gracias por una experiencia muy positivia. Estoy aprendiendo mucho."

	- R.E., you are consistently able to express ideas or fluently and coherently.
	- You have also shown your capacity to look for and make use of structure.
	- However, I find that you struggle to construct a strong foundation in intercultural competence by demonstrating timely knowledge of other cultures and their products at times.
 A strategy to help develop your proficiency is spending time with products of other cultures: music, shows, news, etc, to learn more through environment.

You showed slight improvement through the semester, with a 2 percent increase between the key assessments.

In your essay titled "¡Gatos Y Perros!," I was impressed by your language and thoughtfulness when you wrote the following:
"Sin lugar a dudas, tanto los gatos como los perros son compañeros geniales y cada uno aporta su encanto único a nuestras vidas con sus travesuras juguetonas y su lealtad inquebrantable."
It was quite exciting to see your thoughtfulness in this paper. 

Keep up the good work R.E.! Your final grade for this class: A. R.E., it was wonderful to have you in class this semester. Your focus, energy, and collaborative spirit were on full display every day, and you were an excellent partner in the learning process for everyone in the room. I look forward to all of your future successes at OES and beyond, and thank you!
