AP Statistics involves descriptive statistics (interpreting, organizing, and visualizing data), research design (designing survey, observational studies, and experiments), probability theory, simulation (modeling real-world situations with calculators and computers), and statistical inference. This course is equivalent to one semester of college-level Statistics and prepares students to take the AP Statistics exam. 

Evelyn, in your class reflection, you recognized your developement, saying:
"Will you raise my grade if I win state?"

	- Evelyn, you are consistently able to apply and adapt previous learning to tackle new problems.
	- You have also shown your capacity to ask guiding questions and deeply investigate concepts.
	- However, I find that you struggle to look for and make use of structure at times.
 A strategy to help develop your proficiency is explaining the reasoning behind each decision made in your work.

You showed great improvement through the semester, with a 15 percent increase between the key assessments.
No. Get better at stats WHILE doing practice and then I might raise your grade. 
Hello Evelyn. You have shown understanding on most of the concepts we have learned in class. Your final grade for this class: B.Evelyn, it was great having you in this class this semester. Although you were distracted at times, the effort you put in the class was apparent. Continue this momentum you have built for this class to further improve your work in this class. I am excited to see you next semester!
