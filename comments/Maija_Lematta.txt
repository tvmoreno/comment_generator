AP Statistics involves descriptive statistics (interpreting, organizing, and visualizing data), research design (designing survey, observational studies, and experiments), probability theory, simulation (modeling real-world situations with calculators and computers), and statistical inference. This course is equivalent to one semester of college-level Statistics and prepares students to take the AP Statistics exam. 

Maija, in your class reflection, you recognized your developement, saying:
"I regret everything."

	- Maija, you are consistently able to ask guiding questions and deeply investigate concepts.
	- You have also shown your capacity to look for and make use of structure.
	- However, I find that you struggle to develop and evaluate unique ideas at times.
 A strategy to help develop your proficiency is interpreting the material in new spaces, allowing for new ideas.

You showed slight improvement through the semester, with a 7 percent increase between the key assessments.
