,,Possible LO Strength Words,Possible LO Growth Words,LO Descriptions,LO Strategies,,,Course Descriptions,,,,
,,Innovative,Uncreative,Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them,"interpreting the material in new spaces, allowing for new ideas",,,AP Statistics,"AP Statistics involves descriptive statistics (interpreting, organizing, and visualizing data), research design (designing survey, observational studies, and experiments), probability theory, simulation (modeling real-world situations with calculators and computers), and statistical inference. This course is equivalent to one semester of college-level Statistics and prepares students to take the AP Statistics exam.",,,
,,Reasoned,Unreasoned,Reason abstractly and quantitatively,explaining concepts to others in a teaching format,,,Python III,"This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.

A successful student will know more advanced data structures and object-oriented programming basics.  A successful student will be able to communicate with popular APIs including Twitter and Google in order to “grab” data and to organize the data and display it. ",,,
